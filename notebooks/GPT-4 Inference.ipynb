The sale goes through April 2024 and looks like the rates are refundable but you must stay at least 2 nights. Cheapest dates are January and February as usual but over the Thanksgiving week / few days it's not too bad either. https://www.affinia.com/special-offers/affinia-cyber-sale Any other good offers at other hotels are welcome to be posted in this thread as well.\n",

    "        POST: Hi We are a family of 4, 2 adults, 2 daughters (12yrs & 14yrs). We are flying London to NY (to and from JFK) on Thurs 24th Oct, landing at 3pm, then leaving Sat 26th Oct at midday. It's an extended stop over on route to our main holiday ðŸ˜Š We're staying at Sohotel, Bowrey & I wanted to ask advice on travel/ itinerary. We've found the forums so helpful as the advice has meant we've narrowed down things we'd like to do in the short time we have! Getting to the hotel: At the time of day we land, and with one suitcase/small backpacks, is it better to get the air train/subway or a taxi? Itinerary: Thursday eve, we thought we'd keep it simple and low stress, so Times Square and dinner. Friday we've narrowed it simply to Brooklyn Bridge, Ghostbusters firehouse (we're 80s kids, and our girls love the films!), the free ferry to Statue of Liberty...maybe central park. Can we squeeze in TOTR in the evening? We need to work out which order to do things ðŸ˜¬ Saturday is pack and go - again is the public transport ok in the morning for the flight, or book a taxi? Many thanks for any guidance, I hope I've given enough info!\n",
